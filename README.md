# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis


The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

After cleaning and pre processing part I tried to predict the labels using machine learing algorithm and got accuracy of 50 % but when i predicted using LSTM i got the accuracy of 98%.
